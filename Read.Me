# This project helped me deepin my knowledge on how Python calculates.
# I learned how to turn tables into if/elif/else statements
# I got to use the operators I've learned about further to have a better hands-on experience!
# In the code review on Codecademy it showed me how to make my code more interactive in the future.
# And I can't wait to keep creating more amazing things!
